# CidalsDB
CidalsDB is an open resource on anti-pathogen molecules that provides a chemical similarity-based browsing function and an AI-based prediction tool for the 'cidal' effect of chemical compounds against pathogens. It serves as an evolutive platform for democratized and no-code Computer-Aided Drug Discovery (CADD)
